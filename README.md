Every story has a label.

A complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for classifying news articles into categories using both traditional machine learning (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and deep learning (DistilBERT) approaches.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete text classification pipeline that:
1. Ingests news article data into a SQL database
2. Preprocesses and cleans the text data
3. Trains both traditional ML and transformer-based models
4. Evaluates model performance with detailed metrics
5. Provides a user-friendly Streamlit web application for making predictions
